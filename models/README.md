<h2>Models</h2>
You can find the weights for neural models that we trained in `./models/models.7z`. The size of the file is 4.41 MB and after decompression would be around 5.07 GB. After decompression you'd find the weights of seq2seq models for different variants and different input sequences for both method name prediction and return type recovery in `./models/method_name/` and `./models/type_pred/`. The models are generated using OpenNMT (.pt files). The naming of the file indicates the dataset variant and input variant. For method name prediction, first token is the value of m and second token is the chosen input sequence. For instance, 20_seq3.pt is when m=20 and seq3 is chosen. m is the minimum number of datapoints associated with a method name for it to be included in the dataset. For instance, if
a dataset is created with m = 50, that means each method name in the dataset has at least 50 datapoints associated with itself. For return type recovery, first token is the variant of dataset, similar to SnowWhite and second token is the chosen input sequence. 

In addition to the seq2seq weights, you'd find `./embedding.h5` which is the weights of the keras feedforward NN we used for creating code embeddings.
